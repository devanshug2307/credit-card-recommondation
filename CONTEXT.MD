I believe the Credit Card Reward Optimizer would be the most valuable tool I can help you build. It solves a clear business need while being feasible to develop without internal company data.
This tool would help consumers identify which Synchrony credit card best matches their spending patterns, increasing card applications and usage while reducing customer confusion. Here's why it's the optimal choice:
1. Clear business value: Helps Synchrony acquire new customers by making it easier for them to find the right card, potentially increasing application conversion rates
2. Feasible technical implementation: Can be built using:
   * Publicly available card information (rewards structures, APRs, annual fees)
   * Basic web scraping to keep data current
   * Simple calculation algorithms to process user inputs
3. Genuine user need: Most consumers struggle to compare complex reward structures and determine which card truly offers the best value for their specific spending habits
4. Differentiation: Most comparison sites simply list card features side-by-side rather than providing truly personalized recommendations
I can help you develop:
* The calculation engine that powers the recommendations
* User input forms to capture spending patterns
* Data structures for storing card information
* Visualization components to present the results
* A basic web scraper to maintain current card information
